This is a plug in for OBS that I created for my friend, myself, and others. The main purpose is for when you switch games in OBS.
I've yet to start the project, but will be adding to it when I can.

OBS-Replay-Manager is a plug-in for OBS Studio that dynamically adjusts Replay Buffer durations based on the active scene. 
This eliminates the need to manually navigate settings to change the duration for different games. 
Easily map durations to scenes (e.g., 3 minutes for R6, 1 minute for PUBG) for efficient clipping and storage management.
